I'm Yogesh singh, a web developer with knowledge of frontend and backend languages, frameworks and best code practices. I believe in learning by doing and I follow it, so whenever I have to learn a new technology or framework I just jump in and try to build something with it that I like or use with that. I like watching other people code and also like reading other people's code, I believe that I learn a lot by doing so.
